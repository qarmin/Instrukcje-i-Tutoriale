# Useful tools for checking and fixing C/C++ code (and others languages too)


Probably many of you have encountered errors which, although they were easy to fix (e.g. copy-paste bugs), were hidden in the code for months or years before they were fixed.  
The solution to these problems in many cases are static and dynamic code analyzers and programs to check for memory leaks or CPU time usage by functions that help to better optimize the code and search for bottlenecks.

All tools I'm going to present are free for open-source projects (with a small exception of PVS-Studio, but about that later), many of which can be easily integrated with CI (in my case Gitlab CI) for autimatical code and regression checking.

I have integrated many projects with Sonarcloud, Cppcheck and Coverity Scan, whose code and implementation details can be found here - https://gitlab.com/dashboard/projects.

The results of Sonarcloud scans can be found here - https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/qarmin-1/projects and Cppcheck in pipelins in a given project on Gitlab e.g. https://qarmin.gitlab.io/-/godot/-/jobs/526221853/artifacts/report/index.html


## 1. Cppcheck
This is probably the most basic and easiest to use error search program in C/C++ source files, which does not require compilation of the checked program to work.

All we have to do is enter the project directory and run Cppcheck there, or use the graphical version and click it.

It has many kinds of results presentation, but for me the most convenient method is to export to html (shown in the example at the bottom)

Example of integration with Gitlab CI - https://gitlab.com/qarmin/godot/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L48-59

### Installation on Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install cppcheck cppcheck-gui
```

### Usage
Console - execute these commands inside the project folder, and an HTML file with code and errors will be generated inside the `report` folder
```
cppcheck -q -j8 --enable=all --force --output-file=cppcheck.xml --xml --xml-version=2 .
mkdir report
cppcheck-htmlreport --source-dir=. --title=project --file=cppcheck.xml --report-dir=report
```

## 2. Sonarcloud
Sonarcloud allows you to view and sort potential errors through the website.  
It is free to use for open source projects.  
It finds similar bugs as Cppcheck as opposed to it requires time-consuming compilation.


### Sample Report
Sample Report - https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=qarmin_assimp&resolved=false&rules=c%3AS2095%2Ccpp%3AS1035%2Ccpp%3AS1764%2Ccpp%3AS2259%2Ccpp%3AS2637%2Ccpp%3AS3584%2Ccpp%3AS836&types=BUG

### Usage
Example of integration with Gitlab CI - https://gitlab.com/qarmin/godot/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml

## 3. Coverity Scan

A static analyzer similar in operation to Sonarcloud (you can also view the results online and it is free for open source solutions), but it does not allow to make the results publicly available, so each individual must ask for access to them.  
According to my experience it finds more real errors than previous tools.

### Sample Report
Sample Report(requires a request for access) - https://scan.coverity.com/projects/qarmin-wine?tab=overview

![Coverity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41945903/80742540-d3ae1300-8b1b-11ea-8e24-5d0cdc0054dd.png)

### Usage

Example of integration with Gitlab CI - https://gitlab.com/qarmin/godot/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L7-26

Names like - $COVERITY_SCAN_TOKEN, $GITLAB_USER_EMAIL, $COVERITY_SCAN_PROJECT_NAME should be changed with yours tokens, names etc.  
and also `g++ rr.cpp -o rr.out` should be changed to proper comilation instructions
```
curl -o /tmp/cov-analysis-linux64.tgz https://scan.coverity.com/download/linux64 --form project=$COVERITY_SCAN_PROJECT_NAME --form token=$COVERITY_SCAN_TOKEN
tar xfz /tmp/cov-analysis-linux64.tgz
cov-analysis-linux64-*/bin/cov-build --dir cov-int g++ rr.cpp -o rr.out
tar cfz cov-int.tar.gz cov-int
curl https://scan.coverity.com/builds?project=$COVERITY_SCAN_PROJECT_NAME --form token=$COVERITY_SCAN_TOKEN --form email=$GITLAB_USER_EMAIL --form file=@cov-int.tar.gz

```
## 4. PVS Studio
PVS-Studio is a commercial static code analyzer for detecting typos, errors, and security weaknesses. The analyzer can check the source code offline, i.e. completely isolated from the internet. This is useful for projects with special security and code leakage protection requirements.

PVS-Studio runs on Windows, Linux, macOS environments. It supports integration with such systems as Azure DevOps, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, PlatformIO, Jenkins, SonarQube, Visual Studio and others. A scenario has been developed for the rapid analyzer introduction even in a large old project, which is described, for example, in this [article](https://www.viva64.com/en/b/0687/).

You can download the analyzer and request a one-week trial license by following the link: https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio-download/

Although the analyzer is positioned as a B2B solution, many developers can use it for free both in open source and even in closed source  projects.

**Open source projects.** PVS-Studio can be used free of charge by developers involved in the development of projects hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. A free license doesn't extend to projects' mirrors. It is possible to get a free license for a period of 1 year:
* Go to the page: https://www.viva64.com/en/open-source-license/
* Enter the name and the e-mail, where you will be sent the license key;
* Enter the link to your GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket profile;
* Send a request for the free license.
* Upon expiration of the license, you can get a new license key in the same way.

Additional details of this type of free licensing are described in the article ["Free PVS-Studio for those who develops open source projects"](https://www.viva64.com/en/b/0600/).

**Closed source and academic projects.** For such projects, an alternative option for free licensing is suitable, based on appending comments of a special kind to the analyzed source code. Although such comments may be unacceptable in large enterprise projects, individual developers may well add them to their own projects. This type of free licensing is described in more detail in the article ["How to use PVS-Studio for Free"](https://www.viva64.com/en/b/0457/).

### Sample Report
Sample Report from the Wine check, together with an explanation of the errors can be found here - https://www.viva64.com/en/b/0352/

### Installation and configuration on Ubuntu
1. Download and install the PVS from (deb package) - https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio-download/
2) Installation of the strace package - `sudo apt install strace`
License activation - `pvs-studio-analyzer credentials usermail@gmail.com RRRR-WWWW-RRRR0-TTTD`.
4. Compilation - `pvs-studio-analyzer trace -- g++ rr.cpp -o rr.out`
5. Conversion of results to QtCreator (also available xml, csv, errorfile, html and fullhtml)
```

plog-converter -o ./Tasks.tasks -a GA:1,2 -t tasklist ./Nieczytelny.log
```
6. Opening an error file in QtCreator - `qtcreator Tasks.tasks`.


## 5. Hotspot
A great tool to check the time the program spends on the processor.
Displays the time used by the program between different threads and available processors.
Also allows you to check the number of processor ticks used by each function.


### Sample Report
![Hotspot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41945903/80742547-d577d680-8b1b-11ea-91ad-b543665ab4c0.png)
### Installation on Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install hotspot linux-cloud-tools-generic linux-tools-generic
```

### Usage

1. Open a GUI (best opened with a root account)
2. Click "Record Data".
3. Enter the application path
4. Press "Start Recording"
5. Press "Stop Recording" or turn off the program
6. Click on "View Results"

## 6. Valgrind
Dynamic and open code analyzer.
It has the ability to search for memory leaks, incorrect readings or application profiling.
It runs the code in one thread, so its performance is not very satisfactory for larger projects, but it works perfectly in smaller programs.

```
### Installation on Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install valgrind
```

### Usage
```
g++ rr.cpp -o rr.out
valgrind --leak-check=full ./rr.out
```
## 7. Heaptrack 
Displays in graphic form the number of allocations, memory leaks, memory consumption per time unit.  
It is much faster than Valgrind in detecting memory leaks, but I guess there is no option to display them in text form.

### Sample Report
![Heaptrack](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41945903/80742545-d4df4000-8b1b-11ea-82ca-ffc22b94ca2c.png)

### Installation on Ubuntu(chyba >19.10)
```
sudo apt install heaptrack heaptrack-gui
```

### Usage
```
g++ rr.cpp -o rr.out
heaptrack ./rr.out
heaptrack_gui /home/rafal/heaptrack.rr.out.50388.gz # File name should appear after the previous command
```

## 8. GCC i Clang dynamic analyzers
Both GCC and Clang contain analyzers that check the program for malfunctions during operation.  
Unlike Valgrind, they allow the program to run on many threads, which makes them usually faster (even several times).
A program compiled with their help works even several times slower and takes up several times more RAM.


The following analyzers are available for the moment:
- Leak Sanitizer - responsible for detecting memory leaks.  
It shows how much and where memory has been allocated.   
This tool has minimal overhead.
```
Direct leak of 3672 byte(s) in 51 object(s) allocated from:

./rr.out
```

## 9. Clang i GCC static analyzers
Clang and GCC from version 10 onwards also have static analyzers that can detect potential errors during compilation, which unfortunately extends the time needed for its execution.


### Sample Report
```

    int qq = rr;
    ^~~~~~   ~~

```
### Installation on Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install gcc g++ clang clang-tools
```

### Usage
```
scan-build clang++ rr.cpp -o rr.out #LLVM
gcc rr.cpp -o rr.out -fanalyzer #GCC
```
